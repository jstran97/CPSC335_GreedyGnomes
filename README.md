# CPSC335_GreedyGnomes

Course: Algorithm Engineering

Description: This project simulates a greedy gnome, whose primary goal is to mine as many gold as it possibly can. The two algorithms, namely exhaustive optimization and dynamic programming, are used to calculate and store the best path regarding the number of gold that the gnome can obtain. Correctness, functionality, and efficiency in terms of time are also measured for each algorithm. 

Language(s) used: C++
